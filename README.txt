----Sudoku Solver----
This program solves Sudoku games by looking for the least constrained value and minimizing domain of inputs.  It can currently solved all easy, most medium, and some hard Sudoku puzzles.  The AI works by looking for single values, naked doubles and naked triples in order to reduce the domain of possible values.

More difficult techniques such as the x-wing, naked quadruple, and swordfish could be implemented to solve harder puzzles.

There are several puzzles included within this repository.  Simply download the puzzle that you would like the program to solve and change the path in line 1070 to the location of the file.
